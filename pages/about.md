Hi! I'm Rob, a software developer working in London. This is my personal website.

For my day job, I work for Metaswitch Networks on
[the open-source Project Clearwater](http://github.com/Metaswitch). In
my free time, I am the main developer of the
[SIPp](http://sipp.sf.net) test tool. I also like attending the London
Clojure Dojo, knitting, and watching murder mysteries on Netflix.

You can see [a list of my current projects](|filename|./projects.md), [my Github account](http://github.com/rkday), [my Twitter feed](http://twiiter.com/day_rk) or [my LinkedIn account](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/robert-day/2b/64a/234/).
