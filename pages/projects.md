# Contributions to existing projects

I'm listing these first because I'm more proud of them - they're more challenging (it's harder to understand a pre-existing codebase than one you wrote yourself) and more impactful (even a small change to a popular project is likely to affect more people than something I write myself).

## Shell

## Ruby

[ruby-concurrency](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arkday+is%3Aclosed)

## Clojure/Java

* [schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema/pull/53)
* [jain-sip](https://github.com/RestComm/jain-sip/pull/9)

# My own projects

## Python

*  [nose2dep](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose2dep), a nose2 plugin for expressing a preferred running order for unit tests
*  [mpinfo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MPInfo), a Python package for retrieving information about UK Members of Parliament.

## Ruby

*  I've written [a Diameter stack in Ruby](https://github.com/rkday/ruby-diameter), which is robust enough for me to base a test suite on it (<https://github.com/rkday/fhoss-testcases>).
*  I also wrote [quaff](https://rubygems.org/gems/quaff), a Ruby gem for writing telecoms test scenarios.

## Clojure

*  The [overload-middleware](https://clojars.org/overload-middleware) library, an implementation of the ["Adaptive Overload Control For Busy Internet Servers"](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Emdw/papers/control-usits03.pdf) algorithm in Clojure.
