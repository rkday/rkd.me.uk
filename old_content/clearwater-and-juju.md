I wrote a short piece a while ago on Juju, the software orchestration tool written by Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu Linux), and specifically on orchestrating [Project Clearwater](http://www.projectclearwater.org) with Juju. You can find that at <https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/06/11/clearwater-and-juju/> or <http://www.projectclearwater.org/clearwater-and-juju/>.
